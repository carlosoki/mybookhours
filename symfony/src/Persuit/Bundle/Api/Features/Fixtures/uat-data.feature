To answer your question, attorneys are much more expensive in large part due to the barriers to entry that prevent people from just deciding they are an attorney one day. You will also notice that software development is much more innovative, progressive, and meritocratic than law. The same ease of entry that lowers hourly wages for software developers makes the field advance at a much faster rate than any legal system in the world. I think both fields could learn from one another. |
